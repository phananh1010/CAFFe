If you are using Ubuntu 14 or 16, chance that you will have alot of problem with installation. Here are some notes

a) This link is default installation guide:
http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/install_apt.html
It is a bit confusing. Before compling the source code, you should download the git source first:
#git clone https://github.com/BVLC/caffe
#cp Makefile.config.example Makefile.config

b) OpenCV can be unnecessary complicated (try some top Google link for key work "install opencv 3"). Instead, use this tutorial:
https://gist.github.com/titipata/f0ef48ad2f0ebc07bcb9

c) you may encouter this type of error:

/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lhdf5_hl

Try to reinstall the libhdf5 library:
#sudo apt-get install libhdf5-serial-dev
#sudo ldconfig
and modify the Makefile.config (this is the critical step)
LIBRARY_DIRS := $(PYTHON_LIB) /usr/local/lib /usr/lib /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/hdf5/serial
