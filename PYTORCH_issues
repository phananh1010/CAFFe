Conda is one of the most convinient way to install pytorch. If you have conda in your system, then installing Pytorch is just in few steps.

Note: recently, conda automatically activate base environment. This maybe annoying since your environment path will be overrided by the base.
To force conda to use your environment path, use the following command:
```
conda config --set auto_activate_base false
```
